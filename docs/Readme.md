Advent of Helga
---------------

That's right, we're improving helga, either core or plugins, for Advent 2018.

Dec 2nd-4th was spent doing other stuff cause i haven't thought of this yet.

Dec 5th: add the ability for helga-alkafact to pull a random fact from the DB,
    not requiring an argument.

Dec 9th: starting to get the hang of this daily exercise thing! fixed
a long-standing annoyance in
[helga-mimic](https://github.com/bigjust/helga-mimic) where she would
generate a mimic reply even if the message was a command, thus producing two
confusing outputs.
